\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Considering the shortage of the talent, it's essential for companys to
retain good people and make them well-trained. However, current
situation is not satisfactory while many talents always tend to get a
good job via job-hopping, causing orgnizational churn in employees who
are closely connected to them. In order to simulate this process and
improve it, we build a human capital model based on Social Network
Analysis and Markov process.

\section{Assumptions and Justifications}
\label{sec:assumptions-and-justifications}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{assumption 1} If an employee has probability to
  promote, he won't churn.

The possibility of the unforeseen accidents, which could force an
employee to leave his position,is neglected.Human nature, an employee
will stay at his position to chase for higher level.

\item \textbf{assumption 2} For a vacancy,if there exists an
  employee measures up to it already,ICM won't recruit for it.

Since recruiting good people is difficult, time consuming and
expensive according to issue 5,it is wasteful to recruit for a
position if an employee can promote to it.

\item \textbf{assumption 3} Demotion won't occur.

\item \textbf{assumption 4} Administrative clerk won't promote or be
  transferred.

\item \textbf{assumption 5} For the promotion probability and
  organization change, the other factors effects the churn probability
  is invariable.

Though churn derives from varieties of reasons and they are actually
lacking of known conditions and data to estimate them, we have to
regard it as stable in our model.

\item \textbf{assumption 6} Each division or office have at least one
  middle manager or senior manager.

\label{sec:human-capital-model}

\subsection{Model Overview}
\label{sec:model-overview}

Most research for human capital can be classified as either
microscopic and macroscopic. Since either macroscopic or microscopic
methods are difficult to solve our problem perfectly, we approach the
problem with the combination of macroscopic and microscopic methods.

To measure the ability of each person, we use Quantitative Management
Performance. Via this measurement, we can classify differient kinds of
employees which will influence the promotion process.

To build the employee network and analyze its properties, we employ
the social network analysis (SNA) technique. In our case, the
employees are viewed as nodes and relationships as links among
them. So, We can simulate the complex relationship via this network.

Definitions of symbols employed in this paper are listed in
\textbf{Table 1}.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  Variable & Description \\
  \hline
  $i$            &Index of an employee \\
  $L_{i,t}$          &The level of $i$ \\
  $s_{ij,t}$        &The relation strength from $i$ to $j$ \\
  $a_{ij,t}$        &Represent the influence caused by relationship
                    between superior and subordinate \\
  $f_{ij,t}$        &Represent the influence caused by relationship
                    between person with many friends and person with
                    few friends \\
  $c_{i,t}$        &Clustering Coefficient of $i$
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Human Performance Model}
\label{sec:human-model}

In this part, we buid a people model to evaluate an employee in four
aspects, in terms of \textbf{Quantitative Management Performance} ---
work achievement, work ability, work attitude and potential. These
four aspects are supposed to be quantized according to annual
evaluation based on performance as judged by the supervisor and we
take these independent variables as $A_{ac_i}$, $A_{ab_1}$, $A_{at_i}$
and $A_{po_i}$ for each employee $i$. For each of the four parameters,
it goes from 0 to 1. The statues are used for calculating the
probability that employee can promote. Meanwhile, they influence
leaving probability and team cohesiveness as well.

It is obvious that some of the parameters are somehow more important
than others. So in an effort to make our model more accurate and
reliable,we introduce a weighted index of deviation $AD_i$, with
\begin{equation}
  A_i=w_{ac} \cdot A_{ac_i} + w_{ab} \cdot A_{ab_i} + w_{at} \cdot A_{at_i} +
  w_{po} \cdot A_{po_i}
\end{equation}

We determine weights via the Analytical Hierarchy Process(AHP) [Saaty
1982]. We build a $4 \times 4$ reciprocal matrix by pair comparison:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
       &$A_{ac}$      &$A_{ab}$  &$A_{at}$    &$A_{po}$  \\ \hline
 $A_{ac}$ & 1           & 5 & 2            &1            \\ \hline
 $A_{ab}$ &$\frac{1}{5}$ & 1 &$\frac{1}{3}$ & $\frac{1}{4}$\\ \hline
 $A_{at}$ &$\frac{1}{2}$ & 3 & 1            &1            \\ \hline
 $A_{po}$ &1            & 4 & 1            &1            \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The meaning of the number in each cell is explained in []. The numbers
themselves are based on our own subjective decisions.

We then get the weight of each factor by calculating the bigest
eigenvalue and it's corresponding eigenvector, as given in Table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
  Factor  &$A_{ac}$    &$A_{ab}$   &$A_{at}$    &$A_{po}$\\ \hline
  Weight  &0.3805  &0.0709  &0.2371  &0.3030\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We test the consistency of the preferences for this instance of the
AHP. For good consistency [Alonso and Lamata 2006, 446 - 447]:

\begin{itemize}
\item The principal eigenvalue $\lambda_{max}$ of the matrix should be
  close to the number n of alternatives, here 4; we get $\lambda_{max} = 4.047$.
\item The consistency index $CI = (\lambda_{max}-n)/(n-1)$ should be close to 0; we get $CI = 0.0157$.
\item The consistency ratio $CR = CI/RI$ (where RI is the average
  value of CI for random matrices) should be less than 0.1; we get $CR
  = 0.0182$.
\end{itemize}

Hence, our decision method displays perfectly acceptable consistency
and the weights are reasonable.

\subsection{Social Network Model}
\label{sec:social-network-model}

The social network model contains a directed weighted graph $G(V,E)$
in which $V$ denote the employees and $E$ denote the connection
between employees. Since there are personnel changes, $G(V,E)$ will
change with time goes by. In order to simulate this situation, we use
$G_t(V_t,E_t)$ instead of $G(V,E)$ where $t$ is a discrete
variable. So $G_t(V_t,E_t)$ denote the social network in the $t$-th
month.

First, we explain the way we build edges of $G_t(V_t,E_t)$.

When $t = 0$, there are about $370 \times 85\%$ nodes (employees) in
$G_t$. We build edges between employees in the same division or
office, since employees in the same division or office certainly know
each other. So each division or office form a complete graph and
employees in the differient division or office don't know others,
which is impossible. To solve this problem, we build 10 edges for each
employee with employees in other divisions with equal
probability. Then we build the other edges with probability
$p = \frac{\left|N_{i,t} \cap N_{j,t}\right|}{\left|N_{i,t} \cup
    N_{j,t}\right|}$
which is called Jaccard similarity coefficient[Jaccard 1901].

When $t > 0$, there will be employees leaving or joining the
company. If an employee leave, all his edges with other employees with
be deleted. If an employee newly join the company, he will follow
steps which employees at $t = 0$ take. This is the dynamic process of
graph $G_t(V_t,E_t)$.

Let $s_{ij,t}$ denote the weight from $i$ to $j$ at time $t$. We have
these properties of $G_t(V_t,E_t)$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $s_{ij,t} \ne s_{ij,t}$

  We made this graph directed and weighted because one person may
  consider another person his best friend while that person doesn't
  consider him a good friend. This situation may appear because of the
  relationship between superior and subordinate and the relationship
  between person with more friend and person with less friend. In
  general, $s_{ij,t} \ne s_{ij,t}$ for the reason above.

\item $s_{ij,t}=\dfrac{a_{ij,t}+f_{ij,t}}{2}$

  $a_{ij,t}$ denote the influence caused by the relationship between
  superior and subordinate, $f_{ij,t}$ denote the influence caused by
  the amount of friends for $i$ and $j$. We define
$$a_{ij,t}=\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{2+\left|L_{i,t}-L_{j,t}\right|}, & L_{i,t} \ge L_{j,t} \\
  1-\frac{1}{2+\left|L_{i,t}-L_{j,t}\right|}, & L_{i,t} < L_{j,t} \\
\end{cases}$$
, where $L_{i,t}$ denote the level of $i$ at time $t$, and
$$f_{ij,t}=\frac{\left|N_{i,t} \cap
    N_{j,t}\right|}{\left|N_{i,t}\right|}$$.

\end{itemize}

Finally, we explain the concept of clustering coefficient [Duncan
J. Watts and Steven Strogatz 1998] of $i$ denoted as $c_{i,t}$, which
is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster
together. $c_{i,t}$ is defined as:

$$c_{i,t}=\dfrac{\left| \left\{ s_{jk,t}:v_j,v_k \in M_i,s_{jk,t} \in E
    \right\} \right|}{k_{i,t}(k_{i,t}-1)}$$
where
$M_{i,t}=\left\{ v_j:s_{ij,t} \in E \and s_{ji,t} \in E \right\}$ and
$k_{i,t}=\left| N_{i,t} \right|$.

\subsection{Promote and Churn Model}
\label{sec:promote-and-churn-model}

The main part of our model is the algorithm which controls the
behavior of employees. According to assumption 1 and assumption 2, we
have the methodology as follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item [\textit{step 1}]
\end{itemize}

The network of the company we've built changes in terms of
orgnizational churn and promotion. Considering various of factors in
reality, we build an orgnizational churn and promotion model to
predict the dynamic process.

The first part of the model is churn model.We define the churn rate of
an employee $i$ as $l_i$ to evaluate the probability to churn. $l_i$ is
usually controlled by sorts of factors to different degrees. We
divides $l_i$ into three parts:$l_{i1}$, $l_{i2}$ and$l_{i3}$.  $l_{i1}$
represents the churn rate because of lacking of promotion
opportunity. $l_{i2}$ represents the churn rate because of the changes
of other employees related to employee $i$. To simplify our model, we
presume that $l_i1$, $l_i2$ is linear correlated with $(1-p_i)$ and
$s_i$, which means

\begin{equation}
  l_{i1}=\lambda_1(1-p_i),l_{i2}=\lambda_2s_i
\end{equation}

$\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ could be ensured in later calculation.

$l_{i3}$ represents the other factors we can't get any information from
the known conditons so that we regard it as stable.  Thus

\begin{equation}
  l_i = \lambda_1(1-p_i) + \lambda_2s_i +l_i3
\end{equation}

After analyzing a great deal of churn rate reports, we get the
composition of the three parts are 10.9\%, 2.2\% and 75.4\%
respectively. According to the percentage and the general
churn rate 18\%, we can calculate $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and
$l_{i3}$. As an orinigal condition,it satisfies

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
  \lambda_1 \sum_{i=1}^{370}(1-p_i)=10.9\% \times 370 \times 1.5\% \\
  \lambda_2 \sum_{i=1}^{370}s_i=2.2\% \times 370 \times 1.5\% \\
  l_i3=1.5 \% \times 75.4 \%
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Thus we can use equation (4) to calculate the churn rate $l_i$.

The second part of the model is promotion model aimed to predict the
promotion condition.We define the promotion rate of an employee i as
$p_i$ to evaluate the probability to promote.As a matter of fact,if
there is a vacancy, judging if an employee suits the site involves
work experience and ability.It is essential that he is supposed to
have several years of work experience according to issue 6.If an
employee satisfies the experience condition,it turns out to think
about his ability.Since in people model,each employee's ability is
evaluated by a parameter $A_{D_i}$. For each level of position,it has
an ability standard,as shows in Figure[]. The ability of an employee
are supposed to reach the four standard parameters
respectively,otherwise its $p_i$ is 0.For those who reach the
standard, the promotion probability can be calculated by the equation:
$p_i =\dfrac{A_{D_i}}{\sum_{\alpha} A_{D_\alpha}}$ where $\alpha$ is
employee who have probability to promote.

\section{Performance and Analysis}
\label{sec:performance-and-analysis}

\subsection{Analysis for Task 2}
\label{sec:analysis-for-task-2}

\subsection{Analysis for Task 3}
\label{sec:analysis-for-task-3}

We assume that the company offers training programs for its employees monthly and newly hired employees start to get their salaries next month after they enter the company. With these two assumption, results can be drawn according to our model through simulation. 

Budget can be divided into threee parts: salary budget, training budget and recruiting budget. The budget requirement predicted for next two years is listed in the table below in terms of $\sigma$. 

\begin{tabular}{*{4}{c}}\toprule[2pt]
Total Budget & Salary Budget & Training Budget & Recruiting Budget\\ \midrule
1170.8$\sigma$ & 951.387$\sigma$ & 164.423$\sigma$ & 55.08$\sigma$ \\ \bottomrule[2pt]
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Analysis for Task 4}
\label{sec:analysis-for-task-4}


\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{task4_p.pdf}\\
  \caption{Status of positions}\label{t4_p}
\end{figure}

To analyze the status of positions under different churn rate, we use our model to simulate dynamic processes with these churn rate constraints. We execute our program 100 times for each churn rate and average the predicted values. Figure \ref{t4_p} shows the averaged results our model predicted. Under all of these three conditions, the number of employees in the company keeps rising. The higher the churn rate, the lower the final full rate the company reaches after two years. But ICM can sustain its 80\% for positions even if the churn rate goes to 35\% according to our model's precition.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{task4_r.pdf}\\
  \caption{Recruiting budget}\label{t4_r}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{task4_t.pdf}
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{task4_s.pdf}\\
  \caption{Training budget and salary budget}\label{t4_t_s}
\end{figure}
The churn rate effect the budget of the company as well. The three parts of the bugdet behave differently when churn rate increases. The calculated budget is shown in Figure \ref{t4_r} and Figure \ref{t4_t_s}. Each data point in three charts is an averaged result of 10 predictions and a linear trendline is added to each chart. It is clear that recruiting budget showed in Figure \ref{t4_r} is likely to be proportional to the churn rate while salary budget and training budget showed in Figure \ref{t4_t_s} are likely to be inversely proportional to the churn rate. 

To maintain enough employees, the company has to spend more on recruiting. So high turnover rate directly increase the recruiting budget. High turnover rate's effect on training budget and salary budget is more complex. On the one hand, when churn rate goes up, vacancies in the middle level keeps rising due to long recruiting time and low promote rate. On the other hand, the vacancies in lower level remains low because of the short recruiting time. So the full rate of the company decreases when churn rate rises. Since training budget and salary budget are closely related to full rate, both of them decrease when turnover rate goes up.
\subsection{Analysis for Task 5}
\label{sec:analysis-for-task-5}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{task5_p.pdf}\\
  \caption{Status of position}\label{t5_p}
\end{figure}
We apply following changes to our model to simulate the required process:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Change the churn rate of junior managers and experienced supervisors to 30\%
\item Prohit external recruiting
\item Promoting only qualified employees
\end{itemize}
\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{l|cc}\toprule[2pt]
		\bfseries Level of Position & \bfseries Modified & \bfseries Original\\ \midrule
		Senior manager/Executive & 5.6 & 8.4\\
		Junior manager/Executive & 9.0 & 18.4\\
		Experienced supervisor & 7.4 & 23.0\\
		Inexperienced supervisor & 9.2 & 23.2\\
		Experienced employee & 72.6 & 107.4\\
		Inexperienced employee & 99.6 & 149.6\\
		Administrative clerk & 24.0 & 24.0\\ \bottomrule[2pt]
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Status of position}\label{t5_p_t}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

The result of simulation is shown in Figure \ref{t5_p} and Table \ref{t5_p_t}. All the data shown is an average of ten predictions. While the number of positions occupied remains stable with origial conditions, it drops remarkably with modified conditions.  

We list specific data of each level in Table \ref{t5_p_t}. In the modified case, the numbers of employees are lower than original case especially the those of middle levels. Since there is no external recruiting in modified case, it is obivious that the full rate will decrease due to employees' leave. Although some qualified employees can be promoted into higher level, the high churn rate of the middle level and difficulty of satisfying the promotion conditions make the numbers of middle level employees relatively low. The situation given in that task 5 will cause unrecoverable damage to ICM's HR health. With the full rate of middle level employees lower than 50\%, the HR structure is broken into fragments and the company won't be able to function normally.
